   - Interestingly, while most users identify as male and take short trips, the users identifying as female use the bikes for longer trips. 
### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![tripsbyweekdayperhour.png](Analysis/tripsbyweekdayperhour.png)
   - It appears that bikes are most widely used on the weekdays between 6 and 9 am and 5 and 7 pm, suggesting that a significant portion of users ride bicycles to commute to and from their jobs. 
### User Trips by Gender per Weekday per Hour
##### *Unknown Gender* was omitted for layout purposes.

   - Here, we can see that male-identifying users ride bikes during commuter hours more often than female-identifying users. Their usage during midday Saturday hours is also remarkably high.
### User Trips by Gender per Weekday

   - Primarily, male-identifing subscribers tend to use the bike-sharing service more than any other sub-group. Subscribers also seem more likely to identify their gender than those not suscribed. 
### Top Starting Locations

   - The spread of start locations on this map suggest that many users are moving from the outer neighborhoods into central and south Manhattan. 
### Top Ending Locations
