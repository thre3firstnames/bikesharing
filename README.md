#  Analyzing CitiBike Data with Tableau
## Overview
Using the visualization power of Tableau and the New York City dataset from Citibike, analyze the bike trips from August of 2019 as support for adding bike-sharing services in new cities.

## Results

### Checkout Times for all Users
![checkoutforall.png](Analysis/checkoutforall.png)
   - Based on the results plotted above, most users utilize bike-sharing services for trips lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. 
### Checkout Time by Gender
![checkoutbygender.png](Analysis/checkoutbygender.png)
   - Interestingly, while most users identify as male and take short trips, the users identifying as female use the bikes for longer trips. 
### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![tripsbyweekdayperhour.png](Analysis/tripsbyweekdayperhour.png)
   - It appears that bikes are most widely used on the weekdays between 6 and 9 am and 5 and 7 pm, suggesting that a significant portion of users ride bicycles to commute to and from their jobs. 
### User Trips by Gender per Weekday per Hour
##### *Unknown Gender* was omitted for layout purposes.

   - Here, we can see that male-identifying users ride bikes during commuter hours more often than female-identifying users. Their usage during midday Saturday hours is also remarkably high.
### User Trips by Gender per Weekday

   - Primarily, male-identifing subscribers tend to use the bike-sharing service more than any other sub-group. Subscribers also seem more likely to identify their gender than those not suscribed. 
### Top Starting Locations

   - The spread of start locations on this map suggest that many users are moving from the outer neighborhoods into central and south Manhattan. 
### Top Ending Locations

   - The concentration of end locations south of Central Park on the map might suggest that tourists use the bikes to reach the most popular attractions in the city. 


## Summary
Based on the data from Citibike and the vizualations created in Tableau, it’s clear that the bikesharing program is a successful endeavour in a city where vehicle traffic can be complicated. 

- As another step in the research process, deeper analysis of bike usage will be needed to determine wear. Number of trips & trip duration can be used as factors to indicate when bikes are due for service. 
- Regular station maintenance will also be required for proper longevity. Stations with the heaviest use – determined using starting/ending coordinates – should be considered for upgrades, regular maintenance, and restock from lesser-used stations.
